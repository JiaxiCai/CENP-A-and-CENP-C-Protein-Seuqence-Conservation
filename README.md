# CENP-A-and-CENP-C-Protein-Seuqence-Conservation
It's my project 2E!!! OMG!!!! 

1. Download the Project_2.ipynb file

2. Install all the dependences listed on your computer or in Jupyter Notebook with conda

3. Run the code according to the instructions 
  (it's the best to run the code in Jupyter Notebook, viewing it on GitHub will not give you the MSA viewers)

4. You should get the same files as I have included in the repository! Trouble shoot by checking those files!

5. You can just download the CENPA_tree.newick and CENPC_tree.newick files from the repository if you don't want to modify it yourself. But I included both the originals and the modified for clarity.

I hope you enjoy reading my code!

Have a lovely summer!

Best,
Viv
