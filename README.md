# CENP-A-and-CENP-C-Protein-Seuqence-Conservation
It's my project 2E!!! OMG!!!! 

Download the Project_2.ipynb file
Install all the dependences listed on your computer or in Jupyter Notebook with conda
Run the code according to the instructions
You should get the same files as I have included in the repository! Trouble shoot by checking those files!
You can just download the CENPA_tree.newick and CENPC_tree.newick files from the repository if you don't want to modify it yourself. But I included both the original and the modified just for clarity.

I hope you enjoy reading my code!

Have a lovely summer!

Best,
Viv
